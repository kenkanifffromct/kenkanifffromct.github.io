## Objective

This assignment was focused on refactoring already-functioning code, rather than building from scratch. The web page opened and worked as it should, but there were some tweaks needed behind the scenes inside the code itself. For example, simple semantic restructuring was done within the HTML file to make it more readible. Repetitive "div"'s were sometimes replaced with proper semantic elements(Example: *div class="footer"* replaced with *footer*). Some elements were also grouped together to stylize them under 1 shared class name, instead of individual elements getting the same list of styles. 

Additional made changes include:

"alt" attributes were included within the image elements to assist read-only users.

"title" was changed.

The "seo" span'd portion of "Horiseon" h1 element in the HTML was changed to black in CSS to make it more visible to the user.
